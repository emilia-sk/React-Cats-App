# React-Cats-App
#### A simple app I created while learning React.
- It's a one page app that shows a grid of Bootstrap cards with cat breeds on them
- When you click on the card button, a modal opens with a short summary of the breed and a link to the Purina website, where you can read more about it
- App is fully responsive
- Breed information loads from a custom data.js file
